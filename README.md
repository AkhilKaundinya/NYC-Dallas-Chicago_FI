## Problem Statement
### Introduction
The NYC, Dallas, and Chicago Food Inspection Project is a comprehensive analysis that aims to examine food inspection data from three major cities in the United States. The datasets contain detailed information about food establishments, inspection results, violations, and other relevant factors. By analyzing data from diverse sources, the project seeks to gain valuable insights into the overall food safety and hygiene practices within these urban centers. The objective is to provide stakeholders, including local authorities, restaurant owners, and consumers, with data-driven recommendations to improve food safety standards and regulatory enforcement.

### Business Understanding
Ensuring food safety is a critical concern to protect public health and well-being. The food inspection data from NYC, Dallas, and Chicago provides a valuable opportunity to assess compliance with health and safety regulations among food establishments. By analyzing inspection results, violations, and grades, the project aims to answer key questions related to the number and frequency of inspections, inspection results over time, and the types and severity of violations reported. Additionally, the analysis will identify top-performing and poorly performing food establishments, based on inspection outcomes and attributes such as cuisine and location.

### Business Objectives
The NYC, Dallas, and Chicago Food Inspection Project has the following key objectives:

The NYC, Dallas, and Chicago Food Inspection Project has the following key objectives:

#### 1. Data Profiling: 
Conduct in-depth data profiling with Alteryx to gain comprehensive insights into the food inspection data, ensuring data quality and accuracy for subsequent analysis.

#### 2. Dynamic Dimensional Modeling: 
Create a dynamic dimensional model using ER/Studio to facilitate efficient data analysis, enabling exploration of food inspection data across various dimensions and hierarchies.

#### 3. Data Integration: 
Designed and treamlined data integration with Talend and Alteryx, merging data from multiple sources for robust and reliable profiling.

#### 4. Interactive Dashboards: 
Develop interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to visualize key insights, answering critical business questions such as inspection trends, pass vs. fail rates, and types of violations.

### Conclusion
By leveraging dimensional modeling, data profiling, and data visualization helped adressing key business quistions:-
1. Top ten most inspected and worst-performing establishments based on inspection outcomes over the last two full years
2. Number of food inspections over time.
3. inspection results (pass vs. fail), grades, scores, or score ranges, and the number, severity, and types of violations reported.
4. Food establishments based on attributes such as business type, cuisine, and city boroughs.
